# CreditRisk
# Project Objective

# Background:

Credit risk prediction plays a crucial role in the financial industry, helping banks and financial institutions assess the likelihood of a customer defaulting on credit payments. This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify the probability of clients defaulting based on various factors such as demographic information, payment history, and credit balance.

# Goal:

The goal of this project is to develop a robust credit risk prediction model that can predict whether a client will default on their payment in the next month. The model will utilize various machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict outcomes based on historical data.
